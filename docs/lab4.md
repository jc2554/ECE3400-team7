### FPGA



Starting off from the work of the FPGA subteam of lab 3 last week, the Veriolg code was modified to display the 5x4 grid. The grid, like last week, was composed of white tiles amongst a black background.
\\ show modified code to create grid
The code had to be modified additionally to take in the input from an arduino. Our team decided to use parallel communication for the sake of this lab, with the information being sent in two packets. The input from the arduino would give a current x and y position. 
At those coordinates the tile would temporaily be turend green.
//mention code that shows iput,
\\ show video of the grid parsing through the x and y coordinates
