# ECE 3400   Semester: Fall 2017     
## Team: #7  
### Team Members: Amanda Pathmanathan, Khyati Sipani, Kenneth Cesar Huaman, JinJie Chen, Adrian Dohmann, Sanush Kehelella  

### Team Procedures
- Our regular team meeting will be held on Friday from 4:30 - 5:30 in Upson or Duffield if there is no mandatory team meeting schedule for the week.
- The team leader will set the agenda one day before the meeting and notify everyone on GroupMe. Khyati will make sure that the team is following the agenda during the team meeting. This is the rotation schedule for meeting minutes (switch every week):
  Adrian  
  Jin  
  Amanda  
  Ken  
  Khyati  
  Sanush  
- Both meeting minutes and team agendas will be saved in a Google Drive folder.
- The team will make decisions by majority vote. 
- Our main method of communication will be through GroupMe. Everyone is expected to respond within 3-4 hours of a message if the message was sent between 10 am - 10 pm on weekdays, and are given 12 hours to respond to a message during the weekend.

### Team Expectations
#### Work Quality
- Website Updates: Website updates should not have too much text, have reasonably sized pictures (~640x420), and be concise. Try to use a moderate amount of color when updating the website. One person will be in charge of website updates for the week, and then we will rotate according to the schedule below:

  JinJie  
  Amanda  
  Khyati  
  Sanush  
  Kenneth  
  Adrian  

- Individual Work/Design: Everyone should put a decent amount of effort in their work, and their work should be presentable
- Peer Reviews: Everyone should give honest, constructive, and timely feedback whenever someone completes their task. 
- Website updates from the week’s lab session should be completed before the weekend, so other members on the team can check on it and give feedback in GroupMe.
- Individuals/subteams should complete their part at one day before the deadline so other team members can check their work.
- Deadlines for tasks will be set during weekly meetings or on Monday’s lab session.

#### Strategies to fulfill these standards:
##### Team Participation:
1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: 
  - Team leader will oversee everything to make sure everyone has a task 
  - If there are any conflicts cooperating, the team leader is expected to handle the conflict

2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):
  - Everyone is expected to contribute in meetings
  - Team member should ensure that all ideas are being acknowledged and person taking minutes should take adequate notes
  - If there are two conflicting ideas, team should debate the ideas and pick the better one, but still appreciate any ideas that were contributed

3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance): 
  - Team leader must make sure everyone is doing their tasks
  - Team leader can break up the larger milestone into smaller milestones when helpful and set clear deadlines during team meeting and/or lab session

4. Strategies to get help if you’re stuck:
  - Ask someone on your subteam.
  - If that doesn’t work out, the whole team can discuss the problem.
  - If that doesn’t work out, the team can ask the TAs or professor.

##### Personal Accountability:
1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:
Arrive within 5 minutes of whatever time was scheduled for the meeting. If you cannot show up, inform the team at least one day in advance on GroupMe and if needed the meeting can be rescheduled. Everyone should participate in the team meetings.

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
Team members should be focused on their task during the lab sessions. Everyone should be aware of deadlines, always be giving feedback to each other’s work, and ask questions if anything is unclear. Everyone should be putting effort in their work.

3. Expected level of communication with other team members:
If a poll is sent out or a question is directed towards all team members, everyone should respond promptly (3-4 hours). 
Let everyone know when you are done with a task ASAP and need feedback. If you cannot get the task done for some reason, let the team know well in advance.
During weekly team meetings, everyone should give a brief summary of their task and what they have accomplished thus far.

4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:
Everyone should be participating in polls/voting, weekly meetings, lab sessions, and GroupMe. Tasks should be completed timely. Everyone should be critical but respectful of each other’s work and decisions.

5. How should a team member catch up if they have to miss a meeting: 
If you miss a meeting, go over the meeting minutes and ask any questions to the team leader for that week.
 

#### Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
1. If someone misses a meeting without informing, then they must contribute $5 to the pizza jar. If someone is not putting enough effort in tasks, or not completing them timely, then the team leader during that time must have a discussion with the team member and honestly explain the problem. 

2. If these infractions continue (i.e the person does not abide by the contract, skips most meetings and lab sessions), then the person’s name will not be on the project.
