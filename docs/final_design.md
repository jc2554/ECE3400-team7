## Physical Parts

### Wheels
The wheels previously in use were
### Chasis
The larger size of the wheels now obstructed the placement of the treasure and wall sensors. To accomodate this, a "wing" was designed which would circumvent the wheel and allow mounting of the sensors on the other side. After some difficulties in printing, it was decided that printing via acrylic would give better results. To make better use of the material and to give better support to the "wings", a new chasis was laser cut with the wings already incorporated.
