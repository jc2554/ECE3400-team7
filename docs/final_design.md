# Final Design
Enhancements beyond milestone 4  

## FPGA


## Audio


## Treasure Sensing
### Treasure Sensor Circuit
The same design was kept as in milestone 4, but the I/O was resoldered.
### Amplifier Circuit
The design for the Active High Pass Filter was dropped due to unreliability in performance. One day it would work, the next it would fail. It was decided that a standard non-inverting amplifier would be used for the signal, with an amplitude amplification of 18. This design was also soldered onto a perf board for later use.
## Microphone


## Physical Parts
### Wheels
The previous setup was determined to be too slow. At first a gear box was considered, but 3D printing it proved too difficult. So larger wheels were found from a previous year.
### Chasis
The larger size of the wheels now obstructed the placement of the treasure and wall sensors. To accomodate this, a "wing" was designed which would circumvent the wheel and allow mounting of the sensors on the other side. After some difficulties in printing, it was decided that printing via acrylic would give better results. To make better use of the material and to give better support to the "wings", a new chasis was laser cut with the wings already incorporated.
